Existing psychological large language models (LLMs) mainly depend on supervised fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). They struggle to address dynamic reasoning demands in real-life tasks such as emotion recognition, diagnostic question-answering(QA), and counseling dialogues, as these tasks require simulating complex human cognitive processes such as multi-step causal reasoning and adaptive strategy optimization. Current models still have a gap in meeting these dynamic reasoning demands for real psychological counseling. To solve this problem, we propose an in-depth thinking LLM for psychology. We first constructed 8K verifiable medicopsychological problems and 8K counseling dialogues for training. Then, we presented a two-stage curriculum learning framework, first trained on exam-style problems to build solid reasoning and psychological knowledge, and then on counseling dialogues for dynamic strategy adaptation. Experiments show that our approach outperforms existing open-source general and psychological LLMs across benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of progressive training in handling complex tasks.
