We propose MLeVLM, a Multi-level Visual Language Model for **Medical Visual Question Answering** focusing on recognition, details, diagnosis, knowledge, and reasoning. We construct a high-quality multi-level dataset (MLe-VQA) and a multi-level feature alignment module, and create a benchmark which MLeVLM outperforms.
