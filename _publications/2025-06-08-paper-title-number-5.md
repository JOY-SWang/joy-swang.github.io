To address the challenge of ambiguous symptom descriptions in psychological counseling, we collected STAMPsy, a goal-oriented dataset targeting mixed-type helping needs and stamped by **spatiotemporal-aware** knowledge. Additionally, we develop Self-STAMPsy, an **iterative self-feedback** psychological dialogue generation framework. Recently, we are delving into  [an agent-based workflow](https://github.com/JOY-SWang/CBTI-Agent) under **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** and neuroscience.
