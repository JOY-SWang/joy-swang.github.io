[//]: # (Using [MathJax]&#40;https://www.mathjax.org/&#41; in the description is supported - $$E=mc^2$$ - however, the use must be mindful that the default delimiters are `$$...$$` and `\\[...\\]` which differs from the `$...$` that is typically expected.)
To address the challenge of ambiguous symptom descriptions in psychological counseling, we collected STAMPsy, a goal-oriented dataset targeting mixed-type helping needs and stamped by **spatiotemporal-aware** knowledge. Additionally, we develop Self-STAMPsy, an **iterative self-feedback** psychological dialogue generation framework. Recently, we are delving into  [an agent-based workflow](https://github.com/JOY-SWang/CBTI-Agent) under **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** and neuroscience.
