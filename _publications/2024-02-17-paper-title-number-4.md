citation: 'Wang J., Niu Y., Xu D. \&  Wei Z. We proposed an adaptive framework that couples **perceptual** grounding with reasoning for **LALMs**, ConfAudio, which unifies explicit, reflective reasoning (**fine-tuned** on our novel dataset) with implicit, **pause-driven latent  GRPO** training, via a controller monitors **lowest-group-confidence** and a **composite reward function**.'
