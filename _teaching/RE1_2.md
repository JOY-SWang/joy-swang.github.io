Duration: Apr 2025 - Oct 2025
- Daily maintenance of the self-built RLHF framework, LightRLHF, [DI-engine](https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine), and algorithm and model transfer
- Optimized large audio model on Audio QA via self-iterative chain-of-thought and a group-confidence-aware controller for latent reasoning, achieving improvements of MMAU ↑10pts and MMAR ↑25pts
- Participated in reaction model to music through deep reasoning and duration alignment
