My name is Jieyi Wang(王洁怡 in Chinese), you can also call me Joy, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at Peking University, China, with an expected graduation in June 2026. My research lies at the intersection of LLM (agent, reinforcement learning, multi-modal data), trustworthy medical AI, AI for social good and healthcare applications.

Currently, I am applying for Ph.D. programs. And I am always open to academic discussions and collaborations — please feel free to contact me if our research interests align.
