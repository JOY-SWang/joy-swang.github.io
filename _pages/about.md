My name is Jieyi Wang(王洁怡 in Chinese), you can also call me Joy, and I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at Peking University, China, with an expected graduation in June 2026. My research lies at the intersection of LLM (agent, reinforcement learning, multi-modal data), trustworthy medical AI, AI for social good and healthcare applications.

Currently, I am applying for Ph.D. programs. And I am always open to academic discussions and collaborations — please feel free to contact me if our research interests align.

Beyond the Bio

Outside my work/studies, I'm passionate about Volleyball(playing as a Blocker on the varsity team, which cultivated sharp reflexes, teamwork, and strategic thinking under pressure), Calligraphy (highest certification from China's National Calligraphy Association), and Cooking, and I always have a passion for bringing ideas to life.
